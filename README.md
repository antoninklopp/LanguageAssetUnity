# LanguageAssetUnity
A simple language gestion with XML in Unity Game Engine
Very if you want to translate your game in other languages.

# How to use it
In the Asset folder in your unity project, create a Resources folder.
In this Resources folder, create another folder named "Languages".
In this folder, create as many folders as you want named after Languages (English, French, Spanish...).
Be sure to name them after the Unity applicationLanguage convention if you want it to work (https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemLanguage.html).

Create a new XML file with the same name in each folder.
And put all the strings you want in!

Don't forget to put *using LanguageModule* on top of your C# script.
